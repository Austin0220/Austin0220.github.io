        <h3>Questions/Introduction</h3>
            <p>
                Physical fitness is something that the general public seems misinformed on.
                This opinion I hold led to a desire for understanding of what defines physical fitness 
                and what factors there are to consider when defining weather someone is "fit" or not. 
                This premise led to a few questions, which are as follows.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    What correlation if any is there between body fat and strength?
                </li>
                <li>
                    How does body fat affect physical fitness?
                </li>
                <li>
                    What correlation if any is there between age and fitness?
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The data itself is a study on bodily performance while keeping track of various
                physical traits such as sex, height, weight, and body fat percentage, while also
                keeping track of physical performance metrics, such as grip strength, flexibility,
                jump height, and other factors. 
            </p>
            <h3>
                Pre-Processing
            </h3>
            <p>
                The dataset used was remarkably clean, and as such only required ordering by category
                for certain figures such as class.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Visualizations and Understanding
            </h3>
            <h4>
                Possible Correlations Between Fat and Strength.
            </h4>
            <p>
                One of the first things examined was a scatterplot seen below.
            </p>
            <h4>
                Figure 1
            </h4>
            <figure>
                <img src="projectfiles\Project 1\figure2.2.png">
            </figure>
            <figcaption>
                A scatterplot graph representing the relationship between weight and percentage body fat.
            </figcaption>
            <p>
                While not meaning much on its own, figure 1 establishes a baseline of data for comparison.
                Examining another comparison within the data against the same metric of weight we get another
                scatterplot that looks related.
            </p>
            <h4>
                Figure 2
            </h4>
            <figure>
                <img src="projectfiles\Project 1\figure2.1.png">
            </figure>
            <figcaption>
                A scatterplot graph representing the relationship between weight and grip Strength.
            </figcaption>
            <p>
                Any correlation is hard to see separated like this, so another graph was made to overlap the two plots.
            </p>
            <h4>
                Figure 3
            </h4>
            <figure>
                <img src="projectfiles\Project 1\figure2.png">
            </figure>
            <figcaption>
                A scatterplot graph combining the two above figures.
            </figcaption>
            <p>
                Here we can finally see that, while there is a major overlap, there is no correlation, meaning
                weight and body fat percentage are very important metrics that mean very different things when
                talking about strength. 
            </p>
            <p>
                To answer the primary question of this section, there seems
                to be little correlation with strength and body fat percentage. We can also derrive from this plot
                that the higher grip strength forces correlate to a lower body fat percentage relative to weight.
                This would suggest that there might be a correlation between lower percentages and higher strength,
                but more data is needed to determine this, which is not found in the dataset.
            </p>
            <h4>
                Fat and Age Relative to Fitness
            </h4>
            <p>
                Physical fitness is hard to determine without concrete guidelines. Luckily, this dataset
                categorized the participants into tiered classes based on performance. These "classes" 
                are A, B, C, and D respectively. The breakdown of each of these groups' body fat percentages
                is represented below
            </p>
            <h4>
                Figure 4
            </h4>
            <figure>
                <img src="projectfiles\Project 1\figure3.png">
            </figure>
            <figcaption>
                A boxplot representing general group body fat percentags.
            </figcaption>
            <p>
                Here we see that there is a general trend of the better performers having less body fat percentages,
                which suggests that, at the very least, the more fit you are, the less body fat you will have. This
                point may seem obvious, but the fact that the data shows this commonly held belief is reassuring. It
                shows that, in this case, the layman's perception is based in fact, and no correction should be made.
            </p>
            <p>
                Next is a breakdown by age, using grip strength as a metric for muscle health, and extrapolating
                that to physical fitness as a whole. While not a perfect metric, generally speaking grip strength
                is harder to develop, so those with stronger grips will generally be more fit by nature and by daily
                routine.
            </p>
            <h4>
                Figure 5
            </h4>
            <figure>
                <img src="projectfiles\Project 1\figure5.png"
                width="100%">
            </figure>
            <figcaption>
                A boxplot capturing the general trend of grip strength as related to age from the dataset
            </figcaption>
            <p>
                Here there is a slight, but very much distinguishible decline the further up you go in age. 
                This shows that not only is age related to physical strength, it is one of if not the primary
                factor to consider when discussing fitness aside from diet and excersize. While there are outliers,
                generally a 50 year old is not powerlifting, and a 23 year old is not going to generally be as worried
                about bodily decline.
            </p>
            <p>
                In both cases, we see that general perception holds true to generally accepted premises, which
                is very encouraging.
            </p>
            <h2>
                Impact and Considerations
            </h2>
            <p>
                Many of the visualizations only suggest patterns and general trends. None of them are absolutely
                concrete, primarily because the dataset is catered more toward general health and basic factors
                rather than fitness focused. I could've delved more into blood pressure and how it relates
                to body fat percentage, how it can be a more important outcome of physical fitness than body fat 
                percentage, etc. I do believe, however, that I've  done at least a satisfactory exploration into 
                data that correlates to publicly held beliefs and generally accepted truths, which is always reassuring.
            </p>
