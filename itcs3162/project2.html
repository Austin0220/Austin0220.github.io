        <h2>Project 2</h2>
        <h3>Premise</h3>
        <p>
            The Premise of training this data is twofold. The first component is testing a classification Criteria In the Data itself, being the "Class" parameter. The second is the actual testing and
            Categorization of rows based on factors relating to physical fitness, i.e. % body fat, jump height, weight, etc.
        </p>
        <h2>Methodology</h2>
        <p>
            Overall method will be a decision tree, as the data lends itself well to categorization, in addition to being fantastic for testing the "Class" Field.
        </p>
