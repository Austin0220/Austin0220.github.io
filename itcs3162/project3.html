        <h2>Project 3</h2>
        <h3>Questions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>predicting high systolic, diastolic blood pressure</li>
            <li>Body Fat % based on most other physical factors like height, weight, sit ups, distance leaned forward, etc.</li>
            <li></li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Dataset</h3>
        <p>
            Same dataset as projects 1 and 2, more of the same with analysis of general fitness stats and basic body measurements,
            in addition to the classification and relevant attributes.
        </p>
        <h3>Preprocessing</h3>
        <p>
            In addition to what was done in projects 1 and 2, I had to filter the data to drop certain columns for specific
            correlations and tests.
        </p>
        <h3>Visualization</h3>

                Python code originally in .py file. included in the github link <a href="https://github.com/Austin0220/Austin0220.github.io/blob/main/itcs3162/projectfiles/Project%202/Project2Main.py"> here</a>.
                Comments are for plot and model generation based on test value. Could be improved with an if statement
                but decided to push it to next project.
